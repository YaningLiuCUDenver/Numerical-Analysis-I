    "Arya's instructor knows she has taken math classes and asks her if she could decipher this solution. Although Arya's initial reaction to this assignment can be best described using the word \"despair\", she quickly realizes it is not as bad as she thought. Here is her thought process: the question, in our modern notation is, find $x$ if $x+x/4=15$. The solution starts with an initial guess $p=4$. It then evaluates $x+x/4$ when $x=p$, and finds the result to be 5: however, what we need is 15, not 5, and if we multiply both sides of $p+p/4=5$ by 3, we get $(3p)+(3p)/4=15$. Therefore, the solution is $3p=12$.\n",
